# Semantic Web Mining - Patent Database Dashboard

This is a web dashboard that runs using Java Spring, MySQl , HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Database Setup

Set up mysql with a user 'swmuser' and password 'password' and give the user access to the patents database and use `/data/database/patent_dashboard_db.sql` to insert required data into the database.

## Execution Steps
Execute the java spring backend built using Maven and run a simple http server within the UI folder to have the UI up and running.

## LDA Data location
Document data were processed and tokenized dataframes are stored in pickle files for easier reuse. The generated LDA model and its associated dictionary and corpus are also stored in a shared google drive. The link for the drive - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zTgGrp4pGhyulAFFSbYaoglA3zO2mdWU
